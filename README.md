## Change Log

#### v1.0

- Release version1 reference.

- The models are divided into two categories, of which one is for normal dataset prediction, and another one is for disease datasets prediction. Currently the normal models cover 35 tissues, while the disease models only cover the non-small-cell lung carcinoma, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, which were used to evaluate the performance of SELINA in our paper.

- The models for normal data will be updated every once in a while, and for each update we will add more datasets and cell types into the training data. While for the disease models, we recommend that users use their own data since the disease datasets are extremely diverse for different patients and groups, it is hard to cover all diseases and conditions by us.
